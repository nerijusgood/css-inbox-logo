# Inbox By Google Pure CSS Logo

Really simple yet good looking logo made with pure css. It has some complex shapes, that's why I figured I'd give it a try.

Codepen [demo](http://codepen.io/nerijusgood/pen/bNpvpE "codepen pure css logo") and here is [top 10 css logos](https://www.nerijusgood.com/coding/top-10-codepen-logos-pure-css/ "inbox css pure css") from codepen.

Tested with **firefox** and **chrome**.

Hope you like it. Don't forget to fallow me [@nerijusgood](https://twitter.com/nerijusgood "nerijusgood twitter")
